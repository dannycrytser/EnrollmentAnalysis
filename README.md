The questions that Iâ€™m trying to answer with this project.

    What are the trends in higher-educational enrollment?
    
    Are the trends regional or discipline specific?
    
    Where should higher-education content firms invest in salesforce and content development?

============ DATA SOURCES ============

I used data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which is available at https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data, covering the years 2010-2018. 

============ CONCLUSIONS =============

Overall the enrollment trend was down over this time period. Enrollment took a dive during the years 2010-2012, which only started to slow around the time the data cut off (2018). Since the 2019 data is not available, I can only guess that the Covid pandemic further reduced university enrollment. Filtering by gender I found that enrollment among women stopped dropping before enrollment among men, and there was a slight uptick in enrollment among women toward the end of the data set.  

I found interesting trends at the regional and disciplinary levels. Midwestern regions (Plains and Great Lakes) saw a downturn in enrollment, while Western regions saw an uptick in enrollment, which was mirrored in the Southeast. This corresponds well with various news articles about large midwestern universities struggling to maintain enrollment numbers. 

At the disciplinary level, I no longer looked at enrollment data (since a large number of students do not enroll with a major) but instead looked at a separate survey covering degree completions. This data showed which academic subjects had an uptick in degree completions and which ones saw their completions drop. Many humanities specialties saw their degree completion numbers drop precipitously. At the same time, the mathematics and computer science degree programs saw their numbers rise. I looked at the subfield-data for mathematics to verify my hunch (that the rise in mathematics degree completions was driven by stats programs) and found that the share of math degrees with a 'stats' designation increased quite a bit.
